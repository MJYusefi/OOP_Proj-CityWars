- **Card-based gameplay**: Build your deck and strategically deploy cards to outsmart your opponent.
- **MySQL integration**: Store player progress and game states, allowing players to resume or review past sessions.

## 🛠️ **Tools and Technologies**

- **Java**: Primary programming language for implementing game logic and functionality.  
- **JavaFX**: Framework for developing the graphical user interface (GUI), styled with **CSS**.  
- **MySQL**: Used for database management of user data and game state.  
- **Git**: Version control to manage code and collaborate with teammates.  
- **Trello**: Task management tool to track progress and plan the development process.

## 🚀 **Project Highlights**

- Developed a turn-based card game based on **City Wars: Tokyo Reign**.
- Integrated **MySQL** for user data and game state persistence.
- Created both a **CLI** and **GUI** interface, offering flexibility in how players interact with the game.
- Managed version control with **GitHub** and organized the development process using **Trello**.
